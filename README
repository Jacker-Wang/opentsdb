           |_|    The modern time series database.

OpenTSDB is a distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB) written on
top of HBase.  OpenTSDB was written to address a common need: store, index
and serve metrics collected from computer systems (network gear, operating
systems, applications) at a large scale, and make this data easily accessible
and graphable.

Thanks to HBase's scalability, OpenTSDB allows you to collect thousands of
metrics from tens of thousands of hosts and applications,  at a high rate
(every few seconds). OpenTSDB will never delete or downsample data and can
easily store hundreds of billions of data points.

NOTE: This is a scratch fork that I'm using to rough out code and implement 
features that I hope will find their way into OpenTSDB 2.0. I don't gaurantee
that it will compile every time (you may need to tweak the Makefile to include
missing classes) but it should work normally. 

The API will change a little in this version, but it's fully backwards compatible
with 1.x data, so you could try running this version, play with the changes, and
then return to 1.x without issue. There will be extra data in the 'tsdb-uid' table
but the 'tsdb' table won't be touched.
